      non_existence: Specifies the mechanism used to provide authenticated denial-of-existence responses. non_existence can only be updated when the state is off. Possible values are nsec and nsec3.
      state: Specifies whether DNSSEC is enabled, and what mode it is in Possible values are off, on, and transfer.
      default_key_specs: Specifies parameters that will be used for generating initial DnsKeys for this ManagedZone. If you provide a spec for keySigning or zoneSigning, you must also provide one for the other. default_key_specs can only be updated when the state is off.
        algorithm: String mnemonic specifying the DNSSEC algorithm of this key Possible values are ecdsap256sha256, ecdsap384sha384, rsasha1, rsasha256, and rsasha512.
        key_length: Length of the keys in bits
        key_type: Specifies whether this is a key signing key (KSK) or a zone signing key (ZSK). Key signing keys have the Secure Entry Point flag set and, when active, will only be used to sign resource record sets of type DNSKEY. Zone signing keys do not have the Secure Entry Point flag set and will be used to sign all other types of resource record sets. Possible values are keySigning and zoneSigning.
